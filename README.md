About Me

I am a development researcher working on the political economy of digital platforms, with a focus on platform labour, worker resistance, and emerging alternatives to platform monopolies in India. My research examines how platform capitalism restructures markets and work, how workers respond through unionization and collective action, and how communities experiment with non-extractive, community-governed digital market systems.

I have submitted my PhD at Jawaharlal Nehru University, where my doctoral research examined food delivery platforms and labour relations in India, focusing on labour process, control mechanisms, resistance strategies, and unionization among platform workers. My work is grounded in Global South contexts and informed by direct engagement with labour unions and worker collectives in platform-based work.

Alongside academic research, I am interested in how informal and community-based digital infrastructures can reclaim digital markets that have been privatized and monopolized by large platform corporations.
