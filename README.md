👋 About

I am a development researcher working on the political economy of digital platforms, with a focus on platform labour, worker resistance, and emerging alternatives to platform monopolies in India.

My research examines how platform capitalism restructures markets and work, how workers respond through unionization and collective action, and how communities experiment with non-extractive, community-governed digital market systems. I have submitted my PhD at Jawaharlal Nehru University, where my doctoral work focused on food delivery platforms, labour process, and resistance in India.

My work is grounded in Global South contexts, informed by long-term fieldwork, digital ethnography, and direct engagement with labour unions and worker collectives.
